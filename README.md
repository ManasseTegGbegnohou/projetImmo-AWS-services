## Project Description

I wanted to challenge myself by reworking a school project to make it **compatible with AWS EC2 instances**.

The original project aimed to create a web application built with **React**, connected to a **SQL** database via a **Java** backend. It allows users to browse and view various web pages and listed houses.  
The main objective was to demonstrate the ability to build a functional application by following *Minimum Viable Product* (MVP) principles.

### Main features include:
- Browse listed houses in a gallery view  
- Browse listed houses on a map  
- View detailed information about a house  
- Create an account / Log into an account  
- Add houses to favorites  
- Browse favorite houses

---

### Libraries used:
- **Bootstrap** v5.0.2  
- **@types/react-router-dom**: `npm i @types/react-router-dom`  
- **Axios**: `npm i axios`  
- **React**  
- **Vite**  
- *Etc.*

> ⚠️ This repository is a work in progress. AWS deployment is currently in the testing phase.
